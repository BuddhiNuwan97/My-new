    <h1> HELLO this is my first test code </h1>
    <p>
      My name is Buddhi Nuwan Kumaresingha. I am a passionate and driven IT professional with a focus on Software development and Web Design. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of IT from the University of Moratuwa, 
      I have developed a strong foundation in software development, with a particular interest in creating efficient, user-friendly web applications.
      Since my second year, I have been actively learning and applying key concepts in Quality Assurance, which has sharpened my attention to detail and problem-solving skills. 
      My technical expertise includes proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and experience with frameworks like React and Node.js. 
      I am also familiar with version control systems like Git and comfortable working in agile environments.
      I enjoy working collaboratively to develop ideas, and then reflecting on them independently to ensure high-quality outcomes.
